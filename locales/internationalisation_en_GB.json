  "net_feedback_terms_and_conditions_text": "<p> <strong> i. \nGuarantee scope and period </strong> </p>\r\n\n<Ol> <li> The Gigagary applies to Vodafone customers who have booked a mobile phone contract including data volume. \nTariffs that only contain telephony or only mobile data as well as Red tariffs, Gigacube tariffs or data cards are excluded. \nThe campaign applies until September 30, 2025. To use the gigagary, the previous download of the Meinvodafone app on the smartphone is necessary. \nThe installation of the corresponding Meinvodafone app version is limited on devices with the operating systems iOS from 13 and Android from 6.0. </li>\r\n\n<li> The warranty performance includes the provision of a data volume of 90 GB for the following 24 hours from the time of the customer feedback via the Meinvodafone app if the requirements below are met. \nThe guarantee can only be used once within 30 days. \nAs soon as the data volume of 90 GB and the contractually agreed inclusive volume of the respective tariff are used up, Vodafone reduces the bandwidth to a lower transmission speed. \nThe lower speed of 32 kbit/s corresponds to the agreed regulations of the existing contract. </li>\r\n\n<li> The guarantee is made available by Vodafone without additional costs. \nHowever, this does not affect the paying of the agreed service within the existing contract. </li>\r\n\nThe customer is informed of the Meinvodafone app for runtime contracts as soon as the data volume of 90 GB has been unlocked. \nIn the case of prepaid contracts, a notification is carried out by both SMS and via the Meinvodafone app. </li> </ol>\r\n\r\n\n<p> <strong> II. \nUse of the guarantee </strong> </p>\r\n\n<Ol> <li> In order to be able to use the guarantee, the customer sends his feedback on Vodafone via the Meinvodafone app. \nFor this, it is important that the customer follows the process described in the Meinvodafone app under the menu item \"Gigagary\" and answers the questions asked there. \nThis function is only available in Germany. </li>\r\n\n<li> In order to be able to check the performance of the Vodafone network at the user on site based on the Vodafone's own network systems and to improve the Vodafone network for the user, Vodafone will evaluate personalized information on the network coverage and the quality of the data connections of the customer over the past 4 weeks from the time of feedback delivery. </l>\r\n\r\n\n<p> <strong> III. \nGuaranteed exclusion </strong> </p>\r\n\n<Ol> The guarantee does not apply in the event of accidents, natural disasters and other causes, which are neither controllable nor predictable from Vodafone, including, but not limited to lightning, water, fire, turmoil and inadequate ventilation and climate conditions.\r\n\n<p> <strong> IV. Compensation <br /> </strong> </p>\r\n\n<p> This guarantee does not justify further claims, especially claims for damages. \nThis does not apply, insofar as it is mandatory, especially in the cases of intent or gross negligence, due to the violation of life, body or health or in the event of a violation of essential contractual obligations. \nHowever, the claim for damages for the violation of essential contractual obligations is limited to the predictable damage typical of the contract, unless there is intent or gross negligence or is liable for violation of life, body or health. </p>\r\n \n<p> <strong> V. other </strong> </p> <p> German law applies. \nIf provisions of these guarantee conditions prove to be invalid, they do not touch the validity of the provisions. \nYou agree that the invalid regulation is replaced in such a case by an effective regulation that comes as close as possible to the meaning and purpose of the invalid regulation. </p>",
